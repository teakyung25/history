			<h1>King Shaka Zulu | View on the Current World</h1>
			<h3>  Shaka Zulu was a tyrant and a very powerful intellectual leader of the Zulu Kingdom. To begin, Shaka Zulu was a significant Tyrant as he significantly grew the Zulu empire. He also had high standards, which was the factor that leads to his murder around the age of 41 and did not live to experience the annexation of the Zulu empire. Moving on, Zulu would hate the current world as the Zulu people do not have their personal territory, instead lives in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, the combination of Natal and Zulu territory. Zulu being a tyrant, once with great power in his kingdom would not react well to this. Next, him coming from the year 1828 he will see lots of new advancements in medicines and treatment for the hurt and the sick. He may think of how he could save his mother who died from a disease called dysentery, a infective diarrhea. Finally, his thoughts of his mother's dead will remind him of dark days and at the sight of modern warfare, he would view modern weapons as something that could have saved Zulu territory and his living period. With all the modern advancement of weapons, they were so much more powerful than his short stabbing spears, that could have saved him from his brothers Dingane and Mhlangana stabbing him and european powers annexing the Zulu empire. To conclude, I believe that Shaka Zulu would have a positive view on the world today as he could have used the tools available now to stay as a powerful tyrant for a longer period of time. </h3>
