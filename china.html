			<h1>Empress Ci Xi | View on the Current World</h1>
			<h3>Empress Ci Xi was a very powerful woman in fact she was one of the most powerful women in Chinese history. To start off, the Empress was the first to Modernize China, by expecting western technology, she was not in full support of it, but she saw the importance in modernizing China. After around 110 year after her death, China becomes a communist nation and also a Modernized nation, with big cities like Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, and Shenzhen, which are cities with tall skyscrapers, electricity, and other modernized systems, which would make the Empress happy. Next, the trade around the world has gotten better as transportation vehicles were also modernized and the Empress could see this as a great economic advancement in China, that could not happen at the time of her presence. When she was Empress, China was at war with the U.S. and European powers. Finally, Empress Ci Xi might find it harder to find countries that still practice monarchy, including China and with the amount of greed she had, I believe that the Empress’s reaction to it would not be positive. This is because the amount of power she has would dissipate to a low level. To conclude, I believe the empress would find the positives and negatives of our current world, but she can’t deny the vast amount of technological accomplishments human have made.</h3>
