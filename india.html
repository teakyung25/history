			<h1>Mahatma Gandhi | View on the Current World</h1>
			<h3>	Gandhism/Gandhi’s ideals never died out in this world and the same goes for the violence. To begin, Gandhi always believed in a movement with non-violence and transparency, like the Salt March he leads. Our world at the moment is at both peace and war. To elaborate more, Gandhi lived long enough to see the use of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. At that time, Gandhi stated that “the employment of the atom bomb for the wholesale destruction of men, women, and children as the most diabolical use of science.” However, the uses of science to destruct has not really changed, so Gandhi may not agree with the method of warfare that is continuously developing. Next, Gandhi’s ideals never really faded away because many others worldwide are still practicing it in places like Iran. Moving on, there are things that would make Gandhi view the world in a corrupt way. An example of this would be the current civil war in Syria between the Government and the rebels. Overall, I believe that Gandhi would think that the world has not learned their lesson on how violence ends, but would appreciate peace movements that are occurring to this day.   </h3>
